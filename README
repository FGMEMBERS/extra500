See the Extra500 POH for full procedures! Below are just quickstart.


Engine starting:

- Parking Brake:	Set ( Shift-B or pull out middle Bowden cable in middle console AND press B )
- Battery:		Switch ON
- Fuel Pump 1 or 2:	Switch ON
- Engine Start:		START
- at 12-15% N1:		Press s ( or click on condition lever, its the red one )
CAUTION: TOT limit for starting is max. 10sec above 810degC and below 927degC 
- Standby alternator:	Switch ON
- Generator:		Switch ON
- Engine start:		IGN OFF


Take-off:

- Flaps:		15 degrees ( ] or use the flap switch )
- Power lever:		TRQ 111%
CAUTION: for Take-off (5 minutes) maximum TRQ limit is 111%, TOT 810degC
- Parking Brake:	Release ( Shift-B or push in middle Bowden cable in middle console )
NOTE: For strong sidewind, turn the ailerons against the wind
- At 71KIAS:		Rotate
- Gear:			Retract ( G or click the gear switch )
- Flaps:		0 degrees ( [ or use the flap switch )
CAUTION: Flaps need to be retracted before reaching 120KIAS, gear 140KIAS
- Power lever:		TRQ 92%
CAUTION: For continuous operation the TRQ limit is 92%, TOT 752degC, watch the TOT while climbing!


Climb:
Climb with MCP (maximum continuous Power, 92%TRQ or 752degC) at 110 KIAS.


Descent: 
Descent with 50% TRQ and 2000ft/min. Max airspeed is 207 KIAS.


Landing:
Do not come in too high, too fast.
At 140 KIAS, gear:	Extend (Shift-G or click the gear switch )
At 120 KIAS, flaps:	15 degrees ( ] or use the flap switch )
At 109 KIAS, flaps:	30 degrees ( ] or use the flap switch )
Power for a 3deg descent, 80KIAS and landing configuration is ~30% TRQ
Dont forget to brake. For reverse press R, will only toggle when power lever is in aft position!


Engine shut-off: Press s ( or click on condition lever )

Principle Autopilot functionality (currently in place)

- HDG 		Follows the heading bug
- NAV		Intercepts and tracks VORs, LOCs or your Flight Plan
- NAV/GPSS	Intercepts and tracks your Flight Plan and cuts the corners (Press NAV twice)
- HDG+NAV	Intercept the course with your set heading
- NAV+REV	Intercepts and tracks the LOC back course
- GS		Is armed and activated automatically when captured on the LOC. You can switch it off by pressing APR, 
		ALT mode will become active. To arm the GS again, press APR for a second time 
- VS		Follows the VS bug (limited to +/-1600fpm)
- ALT 		Holds the current altitude (rounded to 100ft)
- ALT+VS	Brings and holds the aircraft to the selected altitude with the selected vertical speed.

To disconnect press: d

General remarks to autopilot operation:
A roll mode (HDG, NAV/GPSS, APR/REV) must be engaged for a pitch mode (ALT, VS, GS) can engage.
A roll mode (HDG, NAV/GPSS, APR/REV) must be engaged for the yaw trim to work
If pitch trim is switched off, autotrim is not available, but the AP will indicate where to (manually) trim to.

The AP will disengage when:
- the disconnect switch is pressed (d)
- the stall warner is on
- absolute g-force (disregarding 1-g gravity) exceeds 0.6g
- manual electric pitch trim is used.  

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Navigation and Communication

Nav 1 or Nav 2 may be selected on the IFD or in the NAV dialog (F12)
The DME will source of either, independent on which NAV is selected (=indicated / used by autopilot in NAV mode)

XPDR squawk can be set in the NAV dialog (F12). Default is 7000 (Europe VFR).
XPDR modes are selected automatically (GND or ALT), but automatic selection may be switched off
Manual mode selection is then possible.
