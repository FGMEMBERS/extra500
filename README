========================================================================

See the Extra500 POH for full procedures! Below are just quickstart.


General Remarks:

All switches are thrown by rotating the mouse wheel in the appropriate direction. Push buttons are pressed by clicking with the LH Mouse button. Rotary knobs are turned by the mouse wheel as well. Hold {{key press|SHIFT}} for large steps.
The IFD buttons on the left, right and lower bezel are always double buttons. Meaning they always have a left and right side. The lower buttons (PFD - FMS - MAP - SYS - CHKL) navigate between the main pages. Once on the selected page the same button will let you navigate through the tabs. The side knobs do not always have a function, but if they have, they are lighted and the function is shown next to them. 
There are a few special Extra500 shortcuts:

CTRL+E  Connect / disconnect External power cart

Principle Autopilot functionality (currently in place)

- HDG 	Follows the heading bug (set HDG bug using the keypad, press to sync)
- NAV		Intercepts and tracks VORs, LOCs or your Flight Plan (set course with LH lower rotary knob on IFD)
- NAV/GPSS	Intercepts and tracks your Flight Plan and cuts the corners (Press NAV twice)
- HDG+NAV	Intercept the course or active flightplan leg with your set heading
- NAV+REV	Intercepts and tracks the LOC back course
- GS		Is armed and activated automatically when captured on the LOC. You can switch it off by pressing APR, 
		ALT mode will become active. To arm the GS again, press APR for a second time 
- VS		Follows the VS bug (limited to +/-1600fpm, set with AP rotary knob)
- ALT 	Holds the current altitude (rounded to 100ft)
- ALT+VS	Brings and holds the aircraft to the selected altitude (set ALT bug using the keypad, press to sync)
		with the selected vertical speed.
- CWS		Control Wheel Steering. Follows the turn rate and vertical speed set by controlling the aircraft. 

To disconnect press: d

General remarks to autopilot operation:
A roll mode (HDG, NAV/GPSS, APR/REV) must be engaged for a pitch mode (ALT, VS, GS) can engage.
A roll mode (HDG, NAV/GPSS, APR/REV) must be engaged for the yaw trim to work
If pitch trim is switched off, autotrim is not available, but the AP will indicate where to (manually) trim to.

For CWS, a roll and pitch mode must be engaged. Press and Hold c (caution: AP servos will disengage!) and with your controls 
bring the aircraft at your wished turn and climb rate. Release c and the AP will engage and keep those rates.

The AP will disengage when:
- the disconnect switch is pressed (d)
- the stall warner is on
- absolute g-force (disregarding 1-g gravity) exceeds 0.6g
- manual electric pitch trim is used.

Navigation and Communication

The COM unit (1 or 2 ) is selected on the audiopanel. Just hit the appropriate "XMT" button. Note that FGCOM only works on COM1!
If you want to hear the NAV station morse code or the marker tones, press the appropriate button on the audiopanel also. 
The volume can be adjusted using the inner volume knob.
 
The active COM standby frequency can be inputted on the keypad. The first "1" is not needed and any trailing "0" neither.
Just type in the frequency and switch active/standby with the button just left of the frequencies.

not-active-COM and NAV standby frequencies are similar, just press the NAV1 / NAV2 button first. 

FMS, Nav 1 or Nav 2 may be selected on the IFD or in the NAV dialog (F12)
The DME source can be set using the AUX button on the keypad. Select with the FMS knob. The DME hold switch next to the DME
indicator overrides all NAV frequency switching and holds the frequency to which the DME was tuned when the HOLD button is pressed.

FMS, Nav 1 or Nav 2 may be selected on the IFD or in the NAV dialog (F12)
The DME source can be set using the AUX button on the keypad. Select with the FMS knob. The DME hold switch next to the DME
indicator overrides all NAV frequency switching and holds the frequency to which the DME was tuned when the HOLD button is pressed.

The FMS (Flight Management System) can be used with or without the autopilot. You can put your flightplan in the 
autopilot - route manager (dont forget to press "activate". The autopilot will intercept the active leg.

While flying a flightplan (FMS is the Nav source and NAV is selected on the autopilot), you can do some special stuff without touching the autopilot:

1. Vectors mode: Press "V with arrow" or "Fly Vectors" knob on IFD to follow the heading bug while still in nav mode. Deselecting will return normal FMS functionality. Handy for making a brief excursion from the flightplan for weather or ATC.

2. Direct-To mode: In the route manager select the waypoint and on the keypad press the "D with arrow" button.
Close to the waypoint direct-to mode will be de-selected automatically or you can do that manually by pressing the same button again.

3. FMS-OBS: Rotate the LH lower knob on the IFD. Press to cancel. Very similar to VOR functionality, except it will work on all waypoints of your flightplan. Very handy for making an approach on an airport without ILS.  

XPDR squawk can be set on the keypad (press XPDR and squawk code) and in the NAV dialog (F12). Default is 7000 (Europe VFR).
XPDR modes are selected automatically (GND or ALT), but automatic selection may be switched off
Manual mode selection is then possible.
The MODE button on the keypad will set the mode manually also.

Pressurization system

The extra500 is certified to 25000ft, where the air is pretty thin. So there is pressurization system that keeps the cabin altitude 
below 8000ft which corresponds to a cabin differential pressure of 5.5psid at 25000ft. So if you are planning to fly above 10000ft, 
you need to make sure that the ENV AIR and PRESS switches (left lower corner) on the side switch panel are on. 
In addition, before take-off you should set the cabin controller (center console) to the airport altitude 
and just after take-off to your target altitude.
Before descending from cruise, set the controller to your target airport altitude. You can monitor the cabin altitude, 
differential pressure and cabin climb rate on the instruments next to the controller.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Night Flying

For lighted instruments switch on the INSTR switch on the side switch panel
On the same panel you can switch the DAY/NIGHT switch to NIGHT for dimming. The 5 round turn knobs
on the panel now can be used to set your dimming level. 
The IFD-s have their own dimming switch on the left upper side of the bezel.
For taxying use the RECO lights. For landing the LDG light.
