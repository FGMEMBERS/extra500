========================================================================

See the Extra500 POH for full procedures! Below are just quickstart.


Engine starting:

- Parking Brake:		Set ( Shift-B or pull out middle Bowden cable in middle console AND press B )
- Battery:		Switch ON
- Fuel Pump 1 or 2:	Switch ON
- Engine Start:		START
- at 12-15% N1:		Press s ( or click on condition lever, its the red one )
CAUTION: TOT limit for starting is max. 10sec above 810degC and below 927degC 
- Standby alternator:	Switch ON
- Generator:		Switch ON
- Engine start:		IGN OFF


Take-off:

- Flaps:			15 degrees ( ] or use the flap switch )
- Power lever:		TRQ 111%
CAUTION: for Take-off (5 minutes) maximum TRQ limit is 111%, TOT 810degC
- Parking Brake:		Release ( Shift-B or push in middle Bowden cable in middle console )
NOTE: For strong sidewind, turn the ailerons against the wind
- At 71KIAS:		Rotate
- Gear:			Retract ( G or click the gear switch )
- Flaps:			0 degrees ( [ or use the flap switch )
CAUTION: Flaps need to be retracted before reaching 120KIAS, gear 140KIAS
- Power lever:		TRQ 92%
CAUTION: For continuous operation the TRQ limit is 92%, TOT 752degC, watch the TOT while climbing!


Climb:
Climb with MCP (maximum continuous Power, 92%TRQ or 752degC) at 110 KIAS.


Descent: 
Descent with 50% TRQ and 2000ft/min. Max airspeed is 207 KIAS.


Landing:
Do not come in too high, too fast.
At 140 KIAS, gear:	Extend (Shift-G or click the gear switch )
At 120 KIAS, flaps:	15 degrees ( ] or use the flap switch )
At 109 KIAS, flaps:	30 degrees ( ] or use the flap switch )
Power for a 3deg descent, 80KIAS and landing configuration is ~30% TRQ
Dont forget to brake. For reverse press R, will only toggle when power lever is in aft position!


Engine shut-off: Press s ( or click on condition lever )

Principle Autopilot functionality (currently in place)

- HDG 	Follows the heading bug (set HDG bug using the keypad, press to sync)
- NAV		Intercepts and tracks VORs, LOCs or your Flight Plan (set course with LH lower rotary knob on IFD)
- NAV/GPSS	Intercepts and tracks your Flight Plan and cuts the corners (Press NAV twice)
- HDG+NAV	Intercept the course or active flightplan leg with your set heading
- NAV+REV	Intercepts and tracks the LOC back course
- GS		Is armed and activated automatically when captured on the LOC. You can switch it off by pressing APR, 
		ALT mode will become active. To arm the GS again, press APR for a second time 
- VS		Follows the VS bug (limited to +/-1600fpm, set with AP rotary knob)
- ALT 	Holds the current altitude (rounded to 100ft)
- ALT+VS	Brings and holds the aircraft to the selected altitude (set ALT bug using the keypad, press to sync)
		with the selected vertical speed.

To disconnect press: d

General remarks to autopilot operation:
A roll mode (HDG, NAV/GPSS, APR/REV) must be engaged for a pitch mode (ALT, VS, GS) can engage.
A roll mode (HDG, NAV/GPSS, APR/REV) must be engaged for the yaw trim to work
If pitch trim is switched off, autotrim is not available, but the AP will indicate where to (manually) trim to.

The AP will disengage when:
- the disconnect switch is pressed (d)
- the stall warner is on
- absolute g-force (disregarding 1-g gravity) exceeds 0.6g
- manual electric pitch trim is used.  

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Navigation and Communication

The COM unit (1 or 2 ) is selected on the audiopanel. Just hit the approprate "XMT" button. Note that FGCOM only works on COM1!
If you want to hear the NAV station morse code or the marker tones, press the appropriate button on the audiopanel also. 
The volume can be adjusted using the inner volume knob.
 
The active COM standby frequency can be inputted on the keypad. The first "1" is not needed and any trailing "0" neither.
Just type in the frequency and switch active/standby with the button just left of the frequencies.

not-active-COM and NAV standby frequencies are similar, just press the NAV1 / NAV2 button first. 

FMS, Nav 1 or Nav 2 may be selected on the IFD or in the NAV dialog (F12)
The DME will source can be set using the AUX button on the keypad. Select with the FMS knob. The DME hold switch next to the DME
indicator overrides all NAV frequency switching and holds the frequency to which the DMe was tuned when the HOLD button is pressed.

The FMS (Flight Management System) can be used with or without the autopilot. You can put your flightplan in the 
autopilot - route manager (dont forget to press "activate"). The autopilot will intercept the active leg.
Direct-To functionality is also included: In the route manager select the waypoint and on the keypad press the "D with arrow" button.
Close to the waypoint direct-to mode will be de-selected automatically or you can do that manually by pressing the same button again.  

XPDR squawk can be set on the keypad (press XPDR and squawk code) and in the NAV dialog (F12). Default is 7000 (Europe VFR).
XPDR modes are selected automatically (GND or ALT), but automatic selection may be switched off
Manual mode selection is then possible.
The MODE button on the keypad will set the mode manually also.

Pressurization system

The extra500 is certified to 25000ft, where the air is pretty thin. So there is pressurization system that keeps the cabin altitude 
below 8000ft which corresponds to a cabin differential pressure of 5.5psid at 25000ft. So if you are planning to fly above 10000ft, 
you need to make sure that the ENV AIR and PRESS switches (left lower corner) on the side switch panel are on. 
In addition, before take-off you should set the cabin controller (centre console) to the airport altitude 
and just after take-off to your target altitude.
Before descending from cruise, set the controller to your target airport altitude. You can monitor the cabin altitude, 
differential pressure and cabin climb rate on the instruments next to the controller.
