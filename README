========================================================================

See the Extra500 POH for full procedures! Below are just quickstart.


Engine starting:

- Parking Brake:	Set (Shift-B)
- Battery:		Switch ON
- Fuel Pump 1 or 2:	Switch ON
- Engine Start:		START
- at 12-15% N1:		Press Ctrl-C (Condition lever forward)
CAUTION: TOT limit for starting is max. 10sec above 810degC and below 927degC 
- Standby alternator:	Switch ON
- Generator:		Switch ON
- Engine start:		IGN OFF


Take-off:

- Flaps:		15 degrees ( ] )
- Power lever:		TRQ 111%
CAUTION: for Take-off (5 minutes) maximum TRQ limit is 111%, TOT 810degC
- Parking Brake:	Release (Shift-B)
NOTE: For strong sidewind, turn the ailerons against the wind
- At 71KIAS:		Rotate
- Gear:			Retract ( G )
- Flaps:		0 degrees ( [ )
CAUTION: Flaps need to be retracted before reaching 120KIAS, gear 140KIAS
- Power lever:		TRQ 92%
CAUTION: For continuous operation the TRQ limit is 92%, TOT 752degC, watch the TOT while climbing!


Climb:
Climb with MCP (maximum continuous Power, 92%TRQ or 752degC) at 110 KIAS.


Descent: 
Descent with 50% TRQ and 2000ft/min. Max airspeed is 207 KIAS.


Landing:
Do not come in too high, too fast.
At 140 KIAS, gear:	Extend (Shift-G)
At 120 KIAS, flaps:	15 degrees ( ] )
At 109 KIAS, flaps:	30 degrees ( ] )
Power for a 3deg descent, 80KIAS and landing configuration is ~30% TRQ
Dont forget to brake. For reverse press R, will only toggle when power lever is in aft position!


Engine shut-off: Press Ctrl-C (to cut the fuel)

Principle Autopilot functionality (currently in place):
- HDG 		Follows the heading bug
- VS		Follows the VS bug (limited to +/-1600fpm)
- ALT 		Holds the current altitude (rounded to 100ft)
- ALT+VS	Brings and holds the aircraft to the selected altitude with the selected vertical speed.

General remarks to autopilot operation:
A roll mode (HDG, NAV/GPSS, APR/REV) must be engaged for a pitch mode (ALT, VS, GS) can engage.
A roll mode (HDG, NAV/GPSS, APR/REV) must be engaged for the yaw trim to work
If pitch trim is switched off, autotrim is not available, but the AP will indicate where to (manually) trim to.

The AP will disengage when:
- the disconnect switch is pressed
- the stall warner is on
- absolute g-force (disregarding 1-g gravity) exceeds 0.6g
- manual electric pitch trim is used.
